## About me
I am currently a Ph.D. student luckily supervised by Prof. [Xunying Liu](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~xyliu/) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/). Before that, I obtained the B.Eng. degree from Faculty of Electronic and Information Engineering at [Xi'an Jiao Tong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2023.

My current research mainly focuses on personalized data generation or augmentation based on generative models to enhance the performance of backend automatic speech recognition systems.
