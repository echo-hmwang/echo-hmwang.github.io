I'm currently a third-year Ph.D. candidate at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html), supervised by Prof. [Xunying Liu](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~xyliu/) and working closely with Prof. [Xurong Xie](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~xrxie?language=en). Before that, I received my B.Eng. degree from the Faculty of Electronic and Information Engineering at [Xi'an Jiao Tong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2023.

My research contributes to more accessible and natural speech interaction by advancing speech foundation models for diverse scenarios, ranging from specialized AI healthcare (e.g. pathological speech recognition) to universal speech generation (e.g. expressive text-to-speech synthesis).

Speciafically, I focus on:

* Dysarthric speech recognition
* Auto-regressive text-to-speech synthesis
* Speech tokenizer
